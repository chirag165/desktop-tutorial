    <h2>Why I Love Cricket</h2>
    <p>
        Cricket is more than just a sport to meâ€”it's a <b>passion</b> that brings joy, energy, and discipline into my life. <br>
        Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the game. The excitement of the matches, the strategies involved, and the team spirit make it truly <i>special</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started playing cricket when I was about eight years old. I used to play with my friends in the neighborhood with makeshift bats and tennis balls. Over the years, my love for cricket has grown stronger, and I now play for my school team. <br>
        It has helped me improve my fitness, concentration, and teamwork skills.

    <h2>My Experience with Cricket</h2>
    <h3>Practice and Dedication</h3>
    <p>
        I practice cricket <b>every weekend</b> at the local sports ground. Our sessions begin with warm-ups and fitness drills, followed by net practice and friendly matches. <br>
        The <i>hard work</i> and dedication I put into each practice session have greatly improved my performance.

    <h3>Memorable Moments</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most memorable moments in my cricket journey was winning the inter-school tournament last year. I was the <u>captain</u> of the team and scored the highest runs in the final match. <br>
        It was a proud moment that I will always cherish!
